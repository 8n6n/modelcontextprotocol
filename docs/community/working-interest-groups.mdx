title: Working and Interest Groups
description: Learn about the two forms of collaborative groups within the Model Context Protocol's governance structure: Working Groups and Interest Groups.
---

Interest Groups work to define _problems_ that MCP should solve by facilitating _discussions_, while Working Groups push forward specific _solutions_ by collaboratively producing _deliverables_ (in the form of SEPs or community-owned implementations of the specification). Interest Group input is a welcome (but not required) justification for creation of a Working Group. Interest Group or Working Group input is collectively a welcome (but not required) input into a SEP or other community contribution.

Long-running Projects (such as SDKs, Inspector, Registry, etc) are maintained by a Working Group dedicated to each respective Project.

## Purpose

These groups exist to:

- **Facilitate high signal spaces for discussion** such that those opting into notifications and meetings feel most content is relevant to them and they can meaningfully contribute their experience and learn from others
- **Create norms, expectations, and single points of involved leadership** around making collaborative progress towards concrete deliverables that help evolve MCP

## Mechanisms

### Interest Groups (IGs)

**Goal**: facilitate discussion and knowledge-sharing among MCP community members with similar interests surrounding some MCP sub-topic or context. The focus is on collecting _problems_ that may or may not be worth solving with SEPs or other community artifacts.

**Expectations**:

- Some regular cadence of async conversations in the corresponding Discord channel
- AND/OR a recurring live meeting attended by 3+ unaffiliated individuals

**Examples**:

- Security in MCP
- Auth in MCP
- Using MCP in an internal enterprise setting
- Tooling and practices surrounding hosting MCP servers
- Tooling and practices surrounding implementing MCP clients

**Lifecycle**:

- Creation begins by filling out a template in the \#wg-ig-group-creation [Discord](/community/communication#discord) channel
- A community moderator will review and call for a vote in the (private) \#community-moderators Discord channel. Majority positive vote by members over a 72h period approves creation of the group. Can be reversed at any time (e.g. after more input comes in). Core and lead maintainers can veto.
- Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing IG into meeting expectations
  - Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group
  - Maintainer is an official representative from the MCP steering group (not required for every group to have this)
- IG is retired only when community moderators or core+ maintainers decide it is not meeting expectations
  - This means successful IG’s will live on in perpetuity

**Creation Template**:

- Facilitator(s)
- Maintainer(s) (optional)
- Flag potential overlap with other IG’s
- How this IG differentiates itself from the related IG’s
- First topic you want to discuss

There is no requirement to be part of an IG to start a WG, or even to start a SEP. However, forming consensus in IG’s to support justifying the creation of a WG is often a good idea. Similarly, citing IG or WG support of a SEP helps the SEP as well.

### Working Groups (WG)

**Goal**: facilitate MCP community collaboration on a specific SEP, themed series of SEPs, or officially endorsed Project.

**Expectations**:

- Monthly progress towards at least one SEP or spec-related implementation OR holds maintenance responsibilities for a Project
- Facilitator(s) is/are responsible for fielding status update requests by community moderators or maintainers

**Examples**:

- Registry
- Inspector
- Tool Filtering
- Server Identity

**Lifecycle**:

- Creation begins by filling out a template in \#wg-ig-group-creation Discord channel
- A community moderator will review and call for a vote in the (private) \#community-moderators Discord channel. Majority positive vote by members over a 72h period approves creation of the group. Can be reversed at any time (e.g. after more input comes in). Core and lead maintainers can veto.
- Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing WG into meeting expectations
  - Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group
  - Maintainer is an official representative from the MCP steering group (not required for every group to have this)
- WG is retired when either:
  - Community moderators or core+ maintainers decide it is not meeting expectations
  - The WG does not have a WIP Issue/PR for at least a month, or has completed all Issues/PRs it intends to pursue.

**Creation Template**:

- Facilitator(s)
- Maintainer(s) (optional)
- Explanation of interest/use cases (ideally from an IG but can come from anywhere)
- First Issue/PR/SEP you intend to procure

## WG/IG Facilitators

A “Facilitator” role in a WG or IG does _not_ result in a [maintainership role](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) across the MCP organization. It is an informal role into which anyone can self-nominate, responsible for helping shepherd discussions and collaboration within the group.

Core Maintainers reserve the right to modify the list of Facilitators and Maintainers for any WG/IG at any time.

## FAQ

> How do I get involved contributing to MCP?

These IG and WG abstractions help provide an elegant on-ramp:

1. Join the Discord, follow the conversation in IGs relevant to you. Attend live calls. Participate.
2. Offer to facilitate calls. Contribute your use cases in SEP proposals and other work.
3. When you're comfortable contributing to deliverables, jump in to contribute to WG work.
4. Do this for a period of time, get noticed by WG maintainers to get nominated as a new maintainer.

> Where can I find a list of all current WGs and IGs?

On the [MCP Contributor Discord](/community/communication#discord), there is a section of channels for each Working Groups and Interest Groups.
